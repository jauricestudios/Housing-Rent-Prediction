# Housing-Rent-Prediction

In this project, we will explore the complexities of housing price prediction using machine learning techniques, with Python as our primary tool. The goal is to develop a model that can predict housing prices based on various factors that influence the real estate market. By leveraging data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help both homebuyers and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

Housing prices are driven by a multitude of factors, both economic and non-economic in nature. These include, but are not limited to, the size and location of the property, neighborhood crime rates, school district quality, proximity to essential services, interest rates, and broader market trends. Understanding how these factors interact and contribute to price variations will be crucial to the success of the prediction model.

Throughout this report, we will explore various approaches to feature selection, data cleaning, and model evaluation. We will also consider the significance of different data attributes in shaping the final price, ensuring that our analysis is both comprehensive and actionable. By doing so, this project aims not only to provide an accurate housing price prediction tool but also to deliver valuable insights into the key determinants that affect the housing market._
